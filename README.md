# norma24
This repository contains the draft of my paper the [Norma 24 conference](https://matematikdidaktik.dk/aktuelt/norma-24), including analysis and output from [R](https://www.r-project.org/), and the data files. The paper is written in [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) [Org-mode](https://orgmode.org/), and the analysis is done in R, mostly by use of the [Quanteda package](https://quanteda.io/). Although the source files can be viewed in any text editor, I recommend using Emacs for the best experience.
