# norma24
This repository contains the draft of my paper the Norma 24 conference, including analysis and output from R, and the data files. The paper is written in Emacs Org-mode, and the analysis is done in R, mostly by use of the Quanteda package. Although the source files can be viewed in any text editor, I recommend using Emacs for the best experience.
